        <h1> Best Southwest Veggie Burgers Ever </h1>

    <h2> So, what is it? </h2>
        <p> If you like earthy, smokey flavors, this is the veggie burger for you. 
            These veggie burgers have just the right amount of sweetness and spice. 
            I like these on the spicy side, but you can tweak the heat level by adding more of or leaving out the spicier ingredients.
            Bonus points: You can make the mix ahead of time and pop them in the oven for 
            an easy dinner. 
        </p>

            <h4> How to make flax egg </h4>
            <p> This is an easy to make vegan egg replacement. Honestly, you won't be able 
                to tell the difference between flax egg and chicken egg in this recipe. 
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Add 1 tablespoon of ground flax seed to a small bowl. </li>  
                    <li> Add 1 1/2 tablespoons cold water to flax seed. </li>
                    <li> Let mixture sit for at least five minutes until its sticky 
                        and congealed. 
                    </li>
                </ul>

        <h2> How do you make them? </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Dice about 1 cup of bell pepper or sweet pepper. Cook in 1 tablespoon of olive oil and add pinch of salt. Cook until the peppers are tender. </li>
            <li> If you want a spicier burger, add 1 minced jalepeno to the peppers when the peppers are almost done. Cook for a minute or two until the jalepeno is fragrant. </li>
            <li> Measure out 3 cups of cooked and rinsed black beans. </li>
            <li> Microwave three medium-sized sweet potatos. </li>
            <li> In a large glass bowl, add 1 1/2 cups of sweet potato and mash it. </li>
            <li> Add beans and cooked peppers to sweet potato mash. Fold to incorporate. </li>
            <li> In a small bowl, mix together:</li> 
                <ul>
                    <li> 3 teaspoons cumin powder </li>
                    <li> 3 teaspoons chili powder </li>
                    <li> 2 teaspoons smoked paprika </li>
                    <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
                    <li> About a 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper </li>
                </ul>
            <li> Add spice mix to the black bean mix and fold to incorporate. </li>
            <li> If you want a nutrition boost, add 2 tablespoons of nutritional yeast and stir to incorporate. </li>
            <li> Add 1 cup of panko or, if you want a healthier binder, pulverized oats. You can pulverize regular oatmeal in your blender or food processor. </li>
            <li> Add egg or flax egg. </li>
            <li> Mix well. I suggest using your hands, but make sure the mixture isn't too hot</li>
            <li> Form into burger patties. </li>
            <li> You have two cooking options: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Add about 2 tablespoons to the same pan you cooked in the peppers in heat to medium. Cook the patties for a few minutes until brown, flip, and cook another few minutes until brown. </li>
                    <li> Bake them in the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for about 30 minutes. Flip the burgers after about 15 minutes for best result. </li>  
                </ul> 
            <li> Once the burgers are done, shake a bit of Tajin on them to taste and enjoy! </li>   
        </ol>
